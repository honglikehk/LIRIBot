# LIRIBot

Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface that is a command line node app that takes in the parameters and gives you back data, the data given back will be pulled from the spotify, Bands in Town for concerts and OMDB for movies APIs.

1. CLearly state the problem the app is trying to solve (ie. What is it doing and why)

The application takes in the users command line arguments and returns data based on the command - that pulls from 3 main APIs

2. Give a high-level overview of how the app is organized

Within the main javascript file named liri.js - I created a switch case organized by the commands - concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this and finally do-what-it-says... when the command is inserted it calls the proper functions that filters the request and calls the page ---- in which pulls data from API and returns the proper information.

3. Include scereenshots, gifs or videos of the app functioning
